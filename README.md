# Symcon-RemoteMirror
Mirrors a branch of local symcon objects to a remote symcon system and synchronises the data in realtime
Structure: "Mirrors a branch" implies it handles the hierarchy/tree structure.
Direction: "To a remote system" correctly implies a one-way push (Local 
→
→
 Remote).
Timing: "Realtime" accurately reflects that it uses event triggers (VM_UPDATE) rather than a scheduled script.
